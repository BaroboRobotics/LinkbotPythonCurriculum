      The Linkbot possesses a simple buzzer which we can use to make music.
      You've heard the buzzer make beeps before&#8212;when the Linkbot boots
      up it plays a short, two-note phrase to let you know that it's awake.

      Fundamentally, these notes are not expressed as the musical pitches you
      might be familiar with&#8212;A&#9839;, G, middle C, etc., or the Do-Re-Mi
      scale&#8212;but rather as frequencies. A note's frequency is a physical
      property, while its pitch, be it "high" or "low", is our brains' perception of
      that frequency. The frequencies themselves oscillate too quickly for us
      to recognize the individual periods. For example, if we were to visualize
      the note middle C as a frequency, only a tenth of a second of it would
      look like this:
    </p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="fig_frequency_of_middle_c"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;6.1.&nbsp; Middle C </b></p><div class="figure-contents">
      
      <div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/frequency_of_middle_c.png" alt="Middle C"></div>
    </div></div><br class="figure-break">
    <p>
      Since we cannot see sound frequencies directly, we use pictures like the
      one above, called waveforms, to visualize them. The spikes at the top
      are called crests and the spikes at the bottom are called troughs.
      If you count the number of crests or troughs, you will notice that there
      are 26. Since we're only looking at one tenth of one second's worth of
      the waveform, we need to multiply by ten to get the number of crests or
      troughs in a full second: 260. This is close to the actual frequency in
      Hertz of middle C: 261.6 Hz. The slight error (1.6) can be explained by
      the partial crest visible at the right end of the waveform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine hearing 261 clicks in a single second! You wouldn't be able to
      tell them apart&#8212;they would blur into one continuous sound, and
      your brain would assign a pitch to that sound. The name of that pitch
      would be middle C, or C<sub>4</sub> in scientific pitch
      notation, which we will introduce soon.

      Here are a few notes and their corresponding frequencies in Hertz. We'll
      be using them in the next section to make a familiar tune.
